<b> GRAPH QUESTIONS </b>  
NOTE:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Most of the questions are implemented in C++.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Files will be complete in themselves. Will not need any custom .h/.hpp files  

[graph](graph.c): Basic implementation of graph in C using adjacency matrix.  
[graphtest](graphtest.cpp): Basic implementation of graph in C++ using adjacency matrix. Requires [this](graph.hpp)  
[DFS](DFS.cpp): DFS traversal of graph.  
[BFS](BFS.cpp): BFS traversal of graph.  
[Topological Sort BFS](topologicalBFS.cpp): Topological sort of directed graph through BFS.  
[Topological Sort DFS](topologicalDFS.cpp): Topological sort of directed graph through DFS.  
[Shortest Path](shortestPath.cpp): Shortest Path in Directed Unweighted Graph.  
[Shortest Path](dijkshtra.cpp): Shortest Path in Directed Weighted Graph (Dijkshtra).
