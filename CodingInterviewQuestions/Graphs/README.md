<b> GRAPH QUESTIONS </b>  
NOTE:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Most of the questions are implemented in C++.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Files will be complete in themselves. Will not need any custom .h/.hpp files  

[graph](graph.c): Basic implementation of graph in C using adjacency matrix.  
[graphtest](graphtest.cpp): Basic implementation of graph in C++ using adjacency matrix. (Requires [this](graph.hpp))  
[DFS](DFS.cpp): DFS traversal of graph.  
[BFS](BFS.cpp): BFS traversal of graph.  
[Topological Sort BFS](topologicalBFS.cpp): Topological sort of directed graph through BFS.  
[Topological Sort DFS](topologicalDFS.cpp): Topological sort of directed graph through DFS.  
[Shortest Path](shortestPath.cpp): Shortest Path in Directed Unweighted Graph.  
[Shortest Path](dijkstra.cpp): Shortest Path in Directed Weighted Graph (Dijkstra).  
[Shortest Path](dijkstraHeap.cpp): Dijkstra using min_heaps.  
[Shortest Path](bellmanFord.cpp): Shortest path in Directed Weighted Graph with negative edges, BellmanFord's Algo.  
[Minimum Spanning Tree](prim.cpp): MST using prim's Algorithm(uses min_heap).  
[Minimum Spanning Tree](kruskal.cpp): MST using kruskal's Algorithm(uses min_heap, not UNION-FIND).
